# Questions and problems
* ":imap <C-i> <C-k>" works, but not works in .vimrc 
* iamcco's vim-markdown plugin sometimes cannot show the content of md file. Maybe it is a problem of port. 
    * To solve this problem:
        * Open a *.md file before configuring the shadowsocks proxy
        * or close the md file and open it agin for a few times.
